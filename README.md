# nyabot
Discord bot that nyas at you

## Behaviour
When someone sends a message containing "nya" in a server shared with nyabot, the bot will choose a nya from an extensible list of possible nyas and reply in the same channel with it.

## Usage
You can [invite my nyabot to your server.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=459132053057699861&scope=bot&permissions=0).

**Warning: my nyabot is not currently online and I have no plans of hosting it anywhere.**

Alternatively you can [follow these guidelines](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/build-a-discord-bot?path=README.md:1:0) to make your own bot using this code. Note that in my version the secret tokens you'll get are kept in a separate `secrets.json` file.
